# What this is.
Gyoza is a Chrome extension that allows you to add a comments section on Aspect, the NFT marketplace on StarkNet.

# Members
We are two 20 year old engineers and designers from Japan.
We just discovered the world of Crypto 2 months ago!

# Inspiration.
I’ve been looking for this NFT for a while, but it’s a little bit expensive. If it were a little cheaper, I’d buy it.”
Have you ever thought so?
We solve such problems.
Gyoza makes price negotiation possible for both sellers and buyers.

# How we built this
You can use a Chrome extension that can do a message when you view an NFT page on aspect.
We use aspect’s API to get the id, contract address, and token id.
The message DB uses Firestore of Firebase.

# In the future
In the future, we will be able to connect to wallet and separate statements for each user.
This way we will be able to determine if the person we trust is trustworthy
